        <blockquote>
            In graph theory, a component of an undirected graph is an induced subgraph 
            in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, 
            and which is connected to no additional vertices in the rest of the graph. 
            For example, the graph shown in the illustration has three components. 
            A vertex with no incident edges is itself a component. 
            Components are also sometimes called connected components.
